Design debt and tech debt was high. Realising the size and scale of the problem I championed the need to solve it.</dd> </div> </dl> <div class="scoped-typography"> <p>It started small with some markdown files, then evolved into a living style-guide, then design decisions were added along with content guidelines, UX requirements, user research and more. My focus was always on building what giffgaff needed, not what I wanted to make. This meant the design system ways solving real problems, helping to build real products and crucially delivered value to giffgaffs members (giffgaff has members not customers and you'll be told off for saying otherwise)</p> <p>As the reputation of the design system grew within the business, so did the demand. I got some budget and hired a kick-ass team of designers and developers to help. We branched out beyond the web and got involved in projects all over the buisness including the app, social campiagns, emails, bus t-sides... if it needed to be designed we were always asked to help.</p> </div> </div> <div> <img src="/website.da3bf577.png" alt="Mobile screenshot of giffgaff.desgin" class="intro__image"> </div> </section> <section class="article-section"> <figure class="article-section__image"> <img src="/pages.de02bd02.png" alt="Components in the design system" style="width:100%;"> <figcaption class="article-section__caption">Bespoke website allowed the documentation to be fully on brand</figcaption> </figure> <div class="scoped-typography"> <h2>Bespoke website</h2> <p>Off the shelf solutions didn't work out. We tried a few, but they all lacked something in either the code or design department.</p> <p>To be a giffgaff design system it had to be uniquley giffgaffy and be a true reflection of how we design and code at giifgaff.</p> <p>We placed equal weight on collaboration, copywriting, design, and development to create a custom website that's full of giffgaff charm without comprimising on code quality</p> </div> </section> <section class="article-section article-section--reverse"> <figure class="article-section__image"> <img src="/components.545f6041.png" alt="Components in the design system" style="width:100%;"> <figcaption class="article-section__caption">A few of the components created in the design system</figcaption> </figure> <div class="scoped-typography"> <h2>Creating components</h2> <p>Tasks involved auditing the current website and apps, A/B testing different varients, colaborating with product teams to get requirements and check if their fit for purpose.</p> </div> </section>  <section class="article-section"> <figure class="article-section__image"> <video width="100%" controls> <source src="/button.2d4bc886.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>  <figcaption class="article-section__caption">Micro interations on hover and click</figcaption> </figure> <div class="scoped-typography"> <h2>Micro interactions</h2>   <p>More than pretty pictures; these were a/b tested agaist static versions and came out on top</p>  </div> </section> <section class="article-section article-section--reverse"> <figure class="article-section__image"> <img src="/hackathon.3cd6df4f.jpeg" alt="Components in the design system" style="width:100%;"> <figcaption class="article-section__caption">Everybody getting involved in the performance hackathon</figcaption> </figure> <div class="scoped-typography"> <h2>Culture</h2> <p>A lot of the work on the design system was centered around promotoing the design system and promoting a design orientated culture.
