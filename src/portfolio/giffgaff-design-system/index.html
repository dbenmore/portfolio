        <section class="intro">
          <div>
            <dl class="info-box">
              <div>
                <dt>Date:</dt>
                <dd>2016 - 2019</dd>

                <dt>Scope:</dt>
                <dd>giffgaff had seen 10 years of growth, 10 years of brand campaigns and 10 years of software development. Design debt and tech debt was high. Realising the size and scale of the problem I championed the need to solve it.</dd>
              </div>
            </dl>
            <div class="scoped-typography">
              <p>It started small with some markdown files, then evolved into a living style-guide, then design decisions were added along with content guidelines, UX requirements, user research and more. My focus was always on building what giffgaff needed, not what I wanted to make. This meant the design system ways solving real problems, helping to build real products and crucially delivered value to giffgaffs members (giffgaff has members not customers and you'll be told off for saying otherwise)</p>

              <p>As the reputation of the design system grew within the business, so did the demand. I got some budget and hired a kick-ass team of designers and developers to help. We branched out beyond the web and got involved in projects all over the buisness including the app, social campiagns, emails, bus t-sides... if it needed to be designed we were always asked to help.</p>

            <h2>Bespoke website</h2>

            <p>Off the shelf solutions didn't work out. We tried a few, but they all lacked something in either the code or design department.</p>

            <p>To be a giffgaff design system it had to be uniquley giffgaffy and be a true reflection of how we design and code at giifgaff.</p>

            <p>We placed equal weight on collaboration, copywriting, design, and development to create a custom website that's full of giffgaff charm without comprimising on code quality</p>

            <h2>The giffgaff button</h2>

            <p>You're probably wondering why I've dedicated a whole section and written so many words about a button. And I agree, it's a bit of a weird thing to do and I'm questioning my sanity. But look at it. It's pretty awesome. And it's more than a pretty peice of UI... To me this one component demonstrates the value of colaboration.</p>

            <h3>From concept to prototype</h3>

            <p>We had some simple yellow buttons with a black border on the website already. These had been A/B tested a lot and every new button we tried just couldn't compete. And to be honest we'd given up a bit on trying to do anything new with them.</p>

            <p>Then came a new concept from one of the brand designers. It had the same yellow background and the same black border but he had added a shadow and some doodles on the corners (I seem to remember that he was pretty obsessed with doodles at the time). It looked good, familiar but more giffgaffy.</p>

            <p>That's when the brainwave hit me - I could animate that. So I did. And it was fun. I was content in having made something and if it never got used I was happy.</p>

            <p>I shared it around the UX team, and back to the brand designer. Everybody seemed to love it. It was oldly weird watching people manically clicking a button over and over again even though it did nothing.</p>

            <h3>Putting the prototype into the wild</h3>

            <p>One of the happy clickers was the optimisation lead and he wanted to A/B test it against the current button. It did amazingly well. Or as the optimisation people say: "a conclusive result". On one page it outperformed the original button by 28%!. How cool is that.</p>
