          <p>Whilst working at giffgaff I championed and lead the creation of a deisgn system.</p>
          <p>This role led me to wearing many hats (Product Owner, Designer, Developer, Line Manager and Agile Coach). It was highly rewarding work that aligned design accros the business. I hired a great team and I'm really proud of what we created.</p>
